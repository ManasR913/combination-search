# combination-search

This is a genetic algorithim application to a simple problem of finding a combination of 10 digits, it follows the general iteration/execution structure of davpal's davpal/eight-queens genetic algorithm. 

The 100% original methods in this project are: fitness and crossover

The general idea is of generating a randomized list of 100 10-digit combinations, and being able to use the general genetic algorithm concept of ranking by fitness, selecting for the next generation with crossover and mutation.

Modifications to alter the behavior and execution of the algorithm can be made with the mutation probability, population size @ line 83, editing the length of the combination, and presetting the base combination.
